# MAP 584
This repository contains the code created for the Course "MAP584 - Mise en oeuvre effective des éléments finis" taken at Ecole Polytechnique during the Spring 2019 term.

## Quickstart
The `finis` package is extensively documented. Please open an ipynb notebook (or IPython console) in the `tp` folder and execute `import finis` and `help(finis)` for a guide on where to start.

## Install
The code relies on [triangle](https://pypi.org/project/triangle/) which should be installed through pip/conda/etc. and other standard packages like numpy/matplotlib/jupyter/etc..

The copyright for all handouts (TPX.pdf where X is the tutorial number) belongs to the [CENTRE DE MATHEMATIQUES APPLIQUEES](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/) at Polytechnique.
